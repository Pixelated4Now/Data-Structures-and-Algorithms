Binary search algorithm in C.
The function takes the array to be searched, the item to be found, the lowest and highest subscripts of the array as parameters.
It accesses the element in the middle of the array.
If this element is equal to the item being searched, its index is returned.
Otherwise, the half of the array that does not contain the target item is discarded.
The function then accesses the element at the middle of the remaining half of the array.
The process continues until the target item is foud, or there are no more elements to be searched.
If the element does not exist in the array, -1 is returned.
