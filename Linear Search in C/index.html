Linear search algorithm in C. 
The algorithm uses a fucntion that takes an integer (from the user), a pre-defined array and the size of the array as parameters. 
It then uses a for loop to check each element in the array against the value to be found. 
If the value is found, the algorithm returns the position of the element in the array and breaks out of the function. 
If the end of the array is reached and the value has not been found, it return -1.
